# StepUp
Small, portable two-step unit for use during assembly of Wren chassis and throughout builds.

![alt tag](https://github.com/wikihouseproject/StepUp/blob/master/StepUp.jpg)

StepUp has multiple uses. Firstly, it is useful for jobs where a little extra height is needed, but a stepladder is unnecessary, and too much bother to continuously relocate. Other key uses include as on-site seating and in order to make a level change between the inside and outside of the house. This is important, as it is unsafe for assemblers to be entering and leaving the house if there is too large a drop.

The most recent design modification introduces an angle at the rear to improve stability.

Distribute the parts for several step ups onto spare spaces on cutting files.
